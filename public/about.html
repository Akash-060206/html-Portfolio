  Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad. I have successfully completed my first year, during which I developed a
  solid understanding of core engineering principles and strengthened my interest in the field of technology. I am
   passionate about learning new concepts and applying them to real-world problems, and I look forward to diving deeper
    into specialized subjects as I move into the next phase of my academic journey.</p>

   my skills and broaden my perspective. Whether it's working on group projects, attending workshops, or contributing to 
   student clubs, I am committed to making the most of my time at MNNIT. My goal is to grow not just as a student, but
    also as a well-rounded individual ready to take on future challenges in the tech world..</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I aim to explore opportunities such as internships, competitive coding, and research projects that align 
  with my interests. I am particularly excited about fields like software development and data science, and I hope to
   contribute meaningfully to innovative work in these areas. With determination and a willingness to learn, I am focused
    on building a strong foundation that will support my long-term career goals in technology and engineering..</p>
